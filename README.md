# Dog Party: Mod 1

This project is a 1-page static site comp to practice writing well structured, semantic HTML with clean, precise CSS, as well as take a first crack at adding some user interaction with Javascript and the DOM.

## Motivation

Being able to take an idea or a mockup and create a replica, is an elementary skill for a good developer and a necessary excercise for a novice. By completing this first pratice project, I now have more experience in understanding the basics of design, positioning, HTML, and CSS. Using media queries is a new skill I have picked up with this project as well.

## Technologies Used

* HTML 
* CSS

## Learning Goals

* practice accurately building a comp
* write well structured, semantic HTML
* craft clean, DRY CSS
* try out working with Javascript to interact with the DOM

## Issues

The nav bar image is larger than the comp.
The header input fields are wider than the comp.
The three body articles are not aligned with the images and headings.
